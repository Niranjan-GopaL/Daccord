Mainly there are 2 sidebars and a main workspace

one clicking a rectangle : the left sidebar shows all the stuff about that rectangle

on dragging, it will move in x , y ,z direction
but on dragging while pressing alt , we can rotate it in 3D 

In the material section in the sidebar for that component ,
in the color option you can upload an image

You can add new material and customise it. Give it some gradient in
whatever direction you want 

You can copy an entire "material"
